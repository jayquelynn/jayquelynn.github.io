## Welcome!

Hello, my name is Jacqueline Turner! 

### About me

I am originally from Kansas City, Missouri. I joined the Marine Corps at the age of 21 and I am now reaching the end of my enlistment at the age of 25. The Marine Corps was fun and exciting but now it is time to move on and use the skills I've learned as a Marine and flourish professionally. I am currently transitioning into the IT field to become a Software Developer with a Microsoft hosted program named, Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA). This is a 18-week program that teaches veterans to become Software Developers. In this academy, veterans learn T-SQL, C#, ASP.NET MVC and Azure. There are multiple languages and software but the listed languages and software helped up understand the basics of what it is like to be a develper.
